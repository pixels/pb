we do depend on your kind words to help spread the
word about us)!

We just ask that you follow these conditions:


YOU MAY NOT:
- Sell or Redistribute this set in any way.




YOU MAY:
- Use these icons in commercial and personal projects
  without attribution (though it would be nice!)

- Post about this icon set on your blog to help us
  share it with more people! Just don't include the
  files please, a friendly link is fantastic!

- Use these icons to make your designs extra awesome.

- Use these icons in Premium WordPress themes that
  you sell so long as there is a link on pages that 
  use the icons to the original download post on
  Tutorial9.net.
